                                    <li>This highlights one of the most critical issues of our project from the outset: the <strong>Imbalanced Dataset Problem.</strong></li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Since our model sees the “paid” class much more frequently, it will tend to make biased predictions toward this class. If we do not address this issue, the model we build could achieve an accuracy rate of over 80% by predicting that every loan is “likely to be paid.” However, this model would have no practical value because it would completely fail to identify risky customers, i.e., the Charged Off class, which is our primary objective.</li>

                                    <li>This imbalance explains why we should focus on metrics such as <strong>Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC</strong> instead of accuracy during the modeling phase, and why we should use resampling techniques like SMOTE or class weights. This graph reminds us that these strategies are not “preferences” but “necessities.”</li>

                                    <li>The histogram on the right clearly shows that loan amounts (loan_amnt) do not follow a normal distribution. Instead, there are multiple peaks (multi-modal) in the distribution. There are noticeable clusters around round numbers such as 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 35,000.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Human Psychology and Demand:</strong> When applying for a loan, people typically prefer round numbers like “10,000” over “9,500.” This is the primary reason behind the peaks in the graph.</li>

                                    <li>These peak points may indicate the presence of non-homogeneous customer groups with different needs in our dataset. For example, a small peak may represent small-need loans, peaks in the 10,000-20,000 range may represent debt consolidation loans, and the largest peak at 35,000 may represent different segments such as larger investments or business loans.</li>

                                    <li>Instead of directly feeding such a complex distribution of a continuous variable into the model, it is a very sensible strategy to categorize it (create loan_amnt_cat using pd.cut). This way, the model can learn these non-linear relationships more easily.</li>

                                        The most common loan amount category in the data set is the 5k-10k range. This is followed by the 10k-15k range.
                                    </li>

                                        In general, as the loan amount category increases, the total number of loans in that category decreases.

                                        In each category, the number of borrowers who have fully paid off their loans (Fully Paid - green) is significantly higher than the number of those who have defaulted (Charged Off - red). 
                                        This reflects the overall class imbalance we previously identified in the dataset.

                                        This graph gives us an idea of the structure of the market by showing where credit demand is concentrated. A large portion of customers use credit between $5,000 and $15,000.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        However, it is difficult to make a clear interpretation of how the loan amount affects the default risk based on this graph alone. Since the total number of loans in each category varies, comparing the ratios of red and green bars visually may be misleading. This is where the graph on the right comes into play and clarifies the picture.

                                        In this graph, we see a very clear and strong trend: As the loan amount category increases, the average default rate (the average of loan_status_bin) in that category also increases systematically.

                                        This is extremely valuable and actionable insight for our project. We can now clearly state that as the amount of credit drawn increases, so does the risk of non-repayment of that credit.

The categorization process (pd.cut) we performed has revealed a strong and monotonic relationship that the model can easily learn.

                                        We see that the vast majority of credits in the data set have a maturity of 36 months (3 years). Credits with a maturity of 60 months (5 years) are in the minority. The ratio appears to be approximately 3 to 1.

                                        This situation indicates that shorter-term borrowing is more common in the credit market. This may be due to both borrowers' desire to pay off their debts more quickly and lenders' tendency to approve shorter-term loans more frequently, as they are considered less risky.

                                        We see that the number of fully paid loans (green) exceeds the number of charged-off loans (red) for both maturities. However, the ratio of the red bar (charge-offs) to its green bar for the 60-month maturity is noticeably larger than the ratio of the red bar to its green bar for the 36-month maturity.

                                        This graph provides the first important clue that risk differs between the two groups. We sense that the default rate may be higher for 60-month loans. However, to see these rates clearly, we need the third graph.

                                        This graph clearly and strongly confirms our suspicion in the previous graph. The default rate for 60-month loans is dramatically higher than the default rate for 36-month loans. According to the graph, while the default rate for 36-month loans is approximately 15-16%, this rate exceeds 35% for 60-month loans.

                                        This is a very important finding for our project. We can clearly state that as the loan term increases, the risk of default also increases exponentially.

                                        Over a 5-year period, the likelihood of a borrower losing their job, experiencing an unexpected health issue, or encountering other financial difficulties is higher than over a 3-year period.

                                        Longer terms, such as 60 months, are typically offered to customers with larger loan amounts (which we have already identified as riskier) or lower monthly payment capacity. Therefore, the 60-month group may have accumulated a riskier customer profile from the outset.

                                The term variable has proven to be an extremely powerful predictor in determining the risk of a loan, despite containing only two categories. During the modeling phase, a loan term of 60 months will be one of the most important signals for the model to flag that loan as “risky.”
