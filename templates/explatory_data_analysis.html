                                    <li>This highlights one of the most critical issues of our project from the outset: the <strong>Imbalanced Dataset Problem.</strong></li>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Since our model sees the “paid” class much more frequently, it will tend to make biased predictions toward this class. If we do not address this issue, the model we build could achieve an accuracy rate of over 80% by predicting that every loan is “likely to be paid.” However, this model would have no practical value because it would completely fail to identify risky customers, i.e., the Charged Off class, which is our primary objective.</li>

                                    <li>This imbalance explains why we should focus on metrics such as <strong>Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC</strong> instead of accuracy during the modeling phase, and why we should use resampling techniques like SMOTE or class weights. This graph reminds us that these strategies are not “preferences” but “necessities.”</li>

                                    <li>The histogram on the right clearly shows that loan amounts (loan_amnt) do not follow a normal distribution. Instead, there are multiple peaks (multi-modal) in the distribution. There are noticeable clusters around round numbers such as 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, and 35,000.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Human Psychology and Demand:</strong> When applying for a loan, people typically prefer round numbers like “10,000” over “9,500.” This is the primary reason behind the peaks in the graph.</li>

                                    <li>These peak points may indicate the presence of non-homogeneous customer groups with different needs in our dataset. For example, a small peak may represent small-need loans, peaks in the 10,000-20,000 range may represent debt consolidation loans, and the largest peak at 35,000 may represent different segments such as larger investments or business loans.</li>

                                    <li>Instead of directly feeding such a complex distribution of a continuous variable into the model, it is a very sensible strategy to categorize it (create loan_amnt_cat using pd.cut). This way, the model can learn these non-linear relationships more easily.</li>

                                        The most common loan amount category in the data set is the 5k-10k range. This is followed by the 10k-15k range.
                                    </li>

                                        In general, as the loan amount category increases, the total number of loans in that category decreases.

                                        In each category, the number of borrowers who have fully paid off their loans (Fully Paid - green) is significantly higher than the number of those who have defaulted (Charged Off - red). 
                                        This reflects the overall class imbalance we previously identified in the dataset.

                                        This graph gives us an idea of the structure of the market by showing where credit demand is concentrated. A large portion of customers use credit between $5,000 and $15,000.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        However, it is difficult to make a clear interpretation of how the loan amount affects the default risk based on this graph alone. Since the total number of loans in each category varies, comparing the ratios of red and green bars visually may be misleading. This is where the graph on the right comes into play and clarifies the picture.

                                        In this graph, we see a very clear and strong trend: As the loan amount category increases, the average default rate (the average of loan_status_bin) in that category also increases systematically.

                                        This is extremely valuable and actionable insight for our project. We can now clearly state that as the amount of credit drawn increases, so does the risk of non-repayment of that credit.

The categorization process (pd.cut) we performed has revealed a strong and monotonic relationship that the model can easily learn.

                                        We see that the vast majority of credits in the data set have a maturity of 36 months (3 years). Credits with a maturity of 60 months (5 years) are in the minority. The ratio appears to be approximately 3 to 1.

                                        This situation indicates that shorter-term borrowing is more common in the credit market. This may be due to both borrowers' desire to pay off their debts more quickly and lenders' tendency to approve shorter-term loans more frequently, as they are considered less risky.

                                        We see that the number of fully paid loans (green) exceeds the number of charged-off loans (red) for both maturities. However, the ratio of the red bar (charge-offs) to its green bar for the 60-month maturity is noticeably larger than the ratio of the red bar to its green bar for the 36-month maturity.

                                        This graph provides the first important clue that risk differs between the two groups. We sense that the default rate may be higher for 60-month loans. However, to see these rates clearly, we need the third graph.

                                        This graph clearly and strongly confirms our suspicion in the previous graph. The default rate for 60-month loans is dramatically higher than the default rate for 36-month loans. According to the graph, while the default rate for 36-month loans is approximately 15-16%, this rate exceeds 35% for 60-month loans.

                                        This is a very important finding for our project. We can clearly state that as the loan term increases, the risk of default also increases exponentially.

                                        Longer terms, such as 60 months, are typically offered to customers with larger loan amounts (which we have already identified as riskier) or lower monthly payment capacity. Therefore, the 60-month group may have accumulated a riskier customer profile from the outset.

                                The term variable has proven to be an extremely powerful predictor in determining the risk of a loan, despite containing only two categories.

                                        The extent to which an individual has borrowed relative to their annual income is one of the most significant factors directly influencing their likelihood of default. This ratio directly measures the individual's debt burden or financial stress. The higher the ratio, the less flexibility remains in the individual's budget to handle unexpected circumstances (job loss, health issues, etc.).

                                        On the X-axis, from left to right, as the income category increases (from 0-40k to 160k+), both the repaid (green) and Charged off (red) loans are shifting upward along the loan_amnt (loan amount) axis.This is an expected and logical situation. It shows that as people's annual income increases, they tend to take out higher amounts of credit, and financial institutions also grant them higher limits.

This may be an indication that individuals are stretching themselves financially beyond their means. The amount of credit borrowed is a risk factor not only in relation to income but also in relation to an individual's borrowing capacity.

This indicates that there is greater diversity in the loan amounts among defaulters. Additionally, there are a large number of outliers in all categories.Outliers, especially at high loan amounts, can affect the performance of our model. However, they also indicate special cases where individuals have taken out loans significantly higher than expected for their income level and are either able to repay them or unable to do so.

                                        This graph confirms and visualizes the story told by the graph on the left from a different angle. While the graph on the left tells us that the “ratio” is important, this graph on the right shows us why this ratio is important. Whether a person is in the 40k-80k income bracket or the 160k+ income bracket, if they take out a relatively higher loan compared to others at their income level, the risk of default increases.

                                In summary, this graph does not simply tell us that “people with low incomes default more often.” A deeper analysis reveals that “regardless of income level, those who borrow relatively more credit for that level are at greater risk of default.”

                                This is evidence of how important the interaction between the annual_inc and loan_amnt variables—rather than each variable alone—might be in the model we are building (for example, the loan_to_income ratio we created).

                        <h4>2. Overall Assessment and Strategic Conclusions</h4>
                        <ul class="analysis-list">
                            <li>
                                When we combine these three graphs, the most important conclusion is as follows:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The lower default rates in the JOINT and DIRECT_PAY categories may not be statistically significant and may be misleading due to the extremely small number of samples in these groups.</li>
                                    <li>Why is this important? An average calculated with very few data points (in this case, the default rate) can vary greatly depending on a few lucky or unlucky outcomes. For example, if there are only 10 applications in the DIRECT_PAY category and only 1 of them defaults, the rate will be 10%. But if, by chance, 2 defaulted, the rate would suddenly jump to 20%. Therefore, relying on rates derived from such small groups is risky.</li>
                                    <li>Implications for the Model: The application_type variable may not be very useful for the model in its current form. If a feature contains nearly all the data in one of its categories (such as INDIVIDUAL), it is very difficult for the model to learn a meaningful pattern from the other categories. During the modeling phase, we might consider combining these rare categories (JOINT and DIRECT_PAY) into a single “Other” category or removing this variable from the model entirely.</li>

                                    <li>This is a very important discovery for our project. Intuitively, we might have expected that people who have been working longer would be more reliable borrowers. However, the data does not support this hypothesis.</li>
                                    <li>When it comes to credit repayment behavior, we see that whether a person has been working for 2 years or 8 years does not make a significant difference. Default risk is nearly the same across all experience levels.</li>
                                    <li>Perhaps a person's financial stability is already captured by other variables such as grade, annual_inc (annual income), and home_ownership (homeownership) rather than emp_length.

                        <p><strong>The main conclusion we draw from this analysis is that work experience (emp_length) is not a strong indicator for predicting credit default risk.</strong></p>
                        <p>This is one of the best aspects of the EDA process; we discover not only which features are important, but also which ones are not as important as expected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Implications for the Model:</strong> The predictive power of the emp_length variable in our model is likely to be low. During the feature selection phase, we might even consider removing this variable from the model to simplify it.</p>

Very low interest rates are only offered to the most reliable customers, while very high rates are only offered to customers considered the most risky.

                                    <li>This is one of the clearest and strongest findings in our project. The interest rate is a direct indicator of a loan's default risk.</li>
                                    <li>Why? This result is actually highly intuitive. Lending institutions assess a customer's risk (by considering factors such as credit score, income status, and debt levels) and apply a higher interest rate to customers they perceive as riskier to compensate for this risk. Therefore, a high interest rate is a signal that the lending institution has already labeled that customer as “risky” from the outset. This graph confirms that the institution's own risk pricing model is working.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p><strong>This analysis has proven that the int_rate variable is one of the most important predictive features for our model. A high interest rate is essentially an “alarm bell” for default.</strong></p>

                                    <li>In the box plot showing the distribution of installments according to loan_status, we see that the box for the Charged Off group is positioned higher than that for the Fully Paid group.

                                    <li>This observation implies that loans with higher monthly installment amounts have a higher risk of default. This is highly logical. The higher the monthly installment amount, the more strained the borrower's monthly budget becomes, and the greater the risk of being unable to make payments in the face of an unexpected financial shock (e.g., an unexpected expense or a small decrease in income).</li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Observation:</strong>

                                    <li>The histogram shows the distribution of monthly installment amounts for both the Fully Paid and Charged Off groups in more detail.</li>
                                    <li>The overall distribution is right-skewed, meaning that most loans have installment amounts concentrated at lower levels (&lt;$500), but there are also a small number of loans with very high installment amounts.</li>
                                    <li>The most important point is that the distribution curve for the Charged Off group (orange/red) is significantly shifted to the right compared to the distribution curve for the Fully Paid group (blue/green).</li>

                                    <li>This histogram not only confirms the finding in the box plot but also reinforces it. The rightward shift in the distribution confirms that defaulted loans generally have higher installment amounts at every level. This indicates a clear distinction between the two groups and demonstrates that the installment amount is a valuable feature for risk estimation.</li>

                        <p><strong>The clear conclusion we can draw from these two graphs is that as the monthly payment burden increases, so does the risk of default.</strong></p>
                        <p>The installment variable is not actually a standalone feature; it is a function of the loan_amnt (loan amount), int_rate (interest rate), and term (maturity) variables. In our previous analyses, we found that all three of these variables have strong relationships with default risk:</p>
                        
                        <ul class="analysis-list">
                            <li><em>High loan_amnt → High Risk</em></li>
                            <li><em>High int_rate → High Risk</em></li>
                            <li><em>Long term (60 months) → High Risk</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The installment variable is a very powerful predictive feature because it summarizes the combination of these three risk factors and their direct impact on the borrower in a single number. Our model will gain important insights into risk by looking at the monthly installment amount of a loan. Another great analysis!</p>

                                    <li>At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive. It raises the question, “Why would someone with verified income default more often?” One possible explanation could be selection bias. The lending institution may subject the incomes of applicants it already perceives as riskier or who show inconsistencies in their application information to stricter verification. In other words, the Verified group may already consist of a riskier population from the outset.</li>
                                    <li>This is a great example of how looking at a single variable can be misleading and how important the interaction between variables can be.</li>

                                    <li>Numerical data confirms and clarifies our observations in the visuals.</li>
                                    <li>Mean: The average credit history of those who paid their loans is 15.85 years, while the average for those who defaulted is 15.36 years.</li>
                                    <li>Median (50%): The median value for those who paid off their loans is 14.49 years, while for those who defaulted, it is 13.92 years.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Analytical Interpretation and Conclusion:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The most important insight we gain from this analysis is that a longer credit history is associated with a lower risk of default, but this relationship is not very strong.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Why is it logical?</strong> A long credit history can indicate that a person has been part of the financial system for a longer period of time, is more experienced in using credit products, and potentially has a more stable financial history. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that these individuals are slightly more likely to repay their debts.</p>
                        <p><strong>What Does It Mean for the Model?</strong> While the credit_history_length variable may not be a very strong predictor on its own, it is a useful feature that will certainly contribute to our model. It will likely become more meaningful when combined with other variables (e.g., age, income, credit score).</p>

                                            <li>This is one of the most interesting findings. Both purposes aim to consolidate existing debts under one roof, and both involve borrowing large amounts of credit (left graph).</li>
                                            <li>However, when we look at the risk profiles (right graph), restructuring credit card debt is one of the lowest-risk purposes, while general debt consolidation is a medium-to-high-risk purpose.</li>

                                                    <li>This suggests that restructuring credit card debt is typically done by a more reliable customer profile with higher financial discipline who is trying to manage their debt. General “debt consolidation,” on the other hand, may encompass a more complex and financially distressed, and therefore riskier, group.</li>

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>This shows that credit risk is not only related to the amount of money borrowed, but also to the life circumstances brought about by the actual purpose. Situations such as education or moving are often associated with periods of high financial uncertainty (e.g., a graduate who has not yet found a job).</li>

                                        This indicates that risk has a non-linear relationship.

                                            <li>Having a small or moderate number of credit accounts (0-15) does not make a significant difference in terms of risk. However, when the number of open accounts a person holds reaches an excessive level (30+), this may indicate potential financial instability or excessive “credit-seeking” behavior. This significantly increases the risk of default.</li>

More importantly, however, the distinction here is even sharper compared to our initial analysis using raw data. Cleaning out the outliers has allowed the true difference between the two groups to emerge more clearly. According to the cleaned data, the high open_total_acc_rate appears to be an even stronger signal for Charged Off.</li>

A person with a low debt balance may still default on their loan, while another with a high debt balance may repay their debt without issue. There is no clear distinguishing power between the variables.</li>

The box for the “Charged Off” group is positioned significantly higher than the box for the “Fully Paid” group. The median utilization rate for the delinquent credit group is significantly higher than that of the paid group.</li>
                                    <li>Histogram (Bottom Right): The distinction in this graph is even more striking.

                                    <li>Here's a critical finding for our project! The credit card utilization rate (revol_util) is a very powerful variable in predicting credit default risk. Borrowers who consistently use a large portion of their credit card limit are more likely to default on their loans.</li>
                                    <li>Why Does This Make Sense? A high utilization rate may indicate that the borrower is financially strained, experiencing liquidity issues, and struggling to manage their existing debts. These individuals are vulnerable to unexpected expenses or even a small drop in income, putting them at risk of defaulting on new credit payments.</li>

                                    <li><strong>It's Not the Amount That Matters, It's the Ratio:</strong> When analyzing credit risk, what matters more than how much debt a person has (revol_bal) is the ratio of that debt to the limit offered to them (revol_util). A person with a credit card debt of $20,000 but a limit of $100,000 (20% utilization) may be much less risky than a person with a debt of $5,000 but a limit of $6,000 (83% utilization).</li>

                                The analysis of these two variables gives us a common and very clear result:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>pub_rec and pub_rec_bankruptcies are “rare event” type predictive variables. That is, they are not found in the majority of the population, but when they are present, they give a very strong negative signal for default risk.</li>
                                    <li>The most important information in these variables is the sharp distinction between a person having 0 records and having 1 or more records. The difference between 1 record and 2 records is not as meaningful and reliable as the difference between 0 and 1.</li>
